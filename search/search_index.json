It has widespread use as a regional and fireline safety and awareness tool. The CFFDRS is undergoing extensive revisions under the name Next Generation CFFDRS (NG-CFFDRS) , with rollout to practitioners occurring during 2024, 2025, and beyond. The primary goal is to meet the evolving needs of advanced users while maintaining it's original simplicity and effectiveness. This website is intended to: inform users about the ongoing changes to the CFFDRS centralize access to the code and documentation host tutorials for new users For those unfamiliar with the CFFDRS, read more about the system at the Government of Canada CFFDRS page . For official information regarding wildfires in Canada, visit the Government of Canada wildfire pages .

The data has been pre-formatted for correct column names, and is in an hourly format. What you'll need: Go to the CFFDRS-NG repo and fork/clone/download the following in the language of your choice: NG_FWI.r , OR NG_FWI.py , OR NG_FWI.c util.r , OR util.py , OR util.c and util.h /data/wx_prf.csv (the data file we will work with) Tutorial_NGFWI.r , OR Tutorial_NGFWI.py , or Tutorial_NGFWI.c Prior to running this tutorial, the user should ensure they have the necessary packages and libraries installed. Each programming language references different packages or libraries, see Code#Documentation for more details, or look in the code files. Step 1: Open the data file: wx_prf.csv About the file: This file contain hourly weather recorded from weather station at the Petawawa Research Forest, during a field season in 2007. The data is sorted into ascending order and has not gaps. The column headers are formatted with the expected inputs, details on the input requirements can be found in Code#Documentation . Notice there is no input for solar radiation ( sol_rad ) or curing faction ( percent_cure ), these are optional inputs and if they are not in the input file, they will be automatically estimated. Open the Tutorial_NGFWI.xx code file. This file contains the step by step process for running NG_FWI. Step 2: Change the file path and load your data file.","title":"Tutorials"},{"location":"tutorials/#how-to-calculate-hourly-fwi-the-new-fwi2025","text":"This tutorial is designed for the user to get familiar how the FWI2025 is calculated with tabular data.
