The Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS) is the principal source of fire information for all wildland fire management agencies across Canada. The CFFDRS is undergoing extensive revisions, with rollout to practitioners occurring during 2024, 2025, and beyond. The primary goal is to meet the evolving needs of advanced users, while maintaining the simplicity and effectiveness of the CFFDRS for its widespread use as a regional and fireline safety and awareness tool.

The information contained here is intended to inform users about these ongoing changes to the CFFDRS, link to the cffdrs-ng Github repository, and store code documentation and tutorials. For official information regarding the CFFDRS, visit the [Government of Canada wildfire pages](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/our-natural-resources/forests/wildland-fires-insects-disturbances/17598).
