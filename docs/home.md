The [Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS)](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/our-natural-resources/forests/wildland-fires-insects-disturbances/canadian-forest-fire-danger-rating-system/14470) is the principal source of fire information for all [wildland fire management agencies](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/campaigns/wildfires/prov.html) across Canada. The CFFDRS is undergoing extensive revisions under the name [Next Generation CFFDRS (NG-CFFDRS)](https://ostrnrcan-dostrncan.canada.ca/handle/1845/245411), with rollout to practitioners occurring during 2024, 2025, and beyond. The primary goal is to meet the evolving needs of advanced users, while maintaining the simplicity and effectiveness of the CFFDRS for its widespread use as a regional and fireline safety and awareness tool.

The information contained on this website is intended to inform users about these ongoing changes to the CFFDRS, link to the [cffdrs-ng GitHub repository](https://github.com/nrcan-cfs-fire/cffdrs-ng/tree/main), and store code documentation and tutorials. For those unfamiliar with the CFFDRS, read more about the system at the [Government of Canada CFFDRS page](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/our-natural-resources/forests/wildland-fires-insects-disturbances/canadian-forest-fire-danger-rating-system/14470).
