## Wildland Fire Suppression

The Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS) is the principal source of fire information for all wildland fire management agencies across Canada. It is a system of scientific models used to assess fire danger and estimate fire behaviour. This national system is also the most widely applied wildland fire danger rating system in the world.

Sharing trained personnel, equipment and knowledge is fundamental to putting out wildland fires. When necessary, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) helps with the exchange of wildland fire fighting personnel, aircraft, equipment and information between jurisdictions. The CIFFC also assists with the exchange of resources between international partners. Mutual aid is the foundation of national and international wildland fire suppression.

The Fighting and Managing Wildfires in a Changing Climate program provides funding for the training of wildland firefighters and the purchasing of equipment to enhance wildland fire management across Canada.
