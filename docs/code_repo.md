# Code Repository

The [cffdrs-ng repository](https://github.com/nrcan-cfs-fire/cffdrs-ng/tree/main) contains the up-to-date code for the CFFDRS2025 modules in three programming languages: R, C, and Python. All three languages contain the same equations and perform the same tasks, the choice is yours depending on your system requirement.
